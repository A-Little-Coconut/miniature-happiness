   <h1>Web Development Reflection</h1>     
     <p> As a new learner to HTML, the most difficult part of the process for me was using Github
            and attempting to memorize the different HTML tags and their uses. Both raw HTML editing
            and using Wordpress have their own unique pros and cons. For example, Wordpress allows
            the user to create a very professional looking site in minutes, but slightly limits how
            much customization the user can actually do. Raw HTML editing on the other hand, is much
            more customizable but takes a lot more work to make it look professional and polished. I
            did not have any trouble with organization in Wordpress, but in HTML I had some
            difficulty making a navigation menu for my pages. I would like to learn more about
            styling in order to further develop my website to make it look more polished.</p>
